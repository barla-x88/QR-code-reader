This web app uses browser's built-in QR code reading feature to read the data embedded in QR codes. The app requires user's permission to access camera. For this app to work properly it it recommended to use a browser which allows access to rear camera.

At this moment Google chrome doesn't have the feature to switch between rear and front camera. This web app was tested in Opera browser on Android.
